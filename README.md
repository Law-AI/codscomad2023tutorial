# AI & Law: Formative Developments, State-of-the-Art Approaches, Challenges & Opportunities
This repository contains all detailed information and resources for this upcoming tutorial at CODS-COMAD 2023, due to be held at IIT Bombay, 3rd January 2023.

# Abstract
Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) are  transforming the way legal professionals and law firms approach their work. The significant potential for the application of AI to Law, for instance, by creating computational solutions for legal tasks, has intrigued researchers for decades. This appeal has only been amplified with the advent of Deep Learning (DL). In particular, research in AI \& Law can be extremely beneficial in countries like India with an overburdened legal system.
    
In this tutorial, we will give an overview of the various aspects of applying AI to legal textual data. 
We will start with a history of AI \& Law, and then discuss the current state of AI \& Law research including the techniques that have produced the biggest impact. We will also take a deep dive into the software processes required to implement and sustain such AI solutions.

# Task-specific Resources
This section contains resources for different automation tasks in the legal domain

## Legal Named Entity Recognition

This task aims to identify different entities in legal documents. Entities may be classified into different groups that have different legal meanings, such as the parties (appellants, respondents), lawyers, judges and so on.

## Legal Judgment Prediction

Broadly speaking, this task aims to determine the outcomes of court cases. In many settings, this may be composed of several sub-tasks, which are addressed in the forthcoming sections.

## Identifying Legal Articles and Charges

Often considered a sub-task of Legal Judgment Prediction, this task aims to identify the relevant legal articles and charges given the facts of a case.

## Semantic Segmentation / Rhetorical Role Labeling

Court case documents are composed of several functional parts such as Facts, Arguments, Ruling, etc. which may not be clearly demarcated. This task aims to automate the process of segmenting a court case document into these parts.

## Pre-trained Language Models for the Legal Domain

Recently there have been many efforts to pre-train large, transformer-based language models for the legal domain, which have been adapted to many down-stream end tasks with spectacular efficiency.
