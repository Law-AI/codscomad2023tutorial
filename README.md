## Legal Named Entity Recognition

This task aims to identify different entities in legal documents. Entities may be classified into different groups that have different legal meanings, such as the parties (appellants, respondents), lawyers, judges and so on.

## Legal Judgment Prediction

Broadly speaking, this task aims to determine the outcomes of court cases. In many settings, this may be composed of several sub-tasks, which are addressed in the forthcoming sections.
